* Removing the prepended comma from Org mode src blocks

As mentioned in <http://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html>,
when at the beginning of the line there is either ",*" or ",#+"
this prepended comma should be removed before parsing.

(Fixes <https://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby/issues/50>)

** DONE Here the prepended comma will be removed.

#+begin_src org
  ,* Hello
  ,** Goodbye
  , *** Not a headline, but prepended comma still removed.
  ,* I am a headline
#+end_src

** DONE Here the prepended comma is should not be removed.
