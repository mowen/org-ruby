#+INCLUDE: "./spec/html_examples/escape-pre.org"
the included file above will be rendered.
#+END_COMMENT

* DONE Within a center block

#+BEGIN_CENTER

#+INCLUDE: "./spec/html_examples/inline-images.org"

#+END_CENTER

* TODO Within a source code block				   :noexport:

It should not be possible to include a file within a source code block.
(Some versions of Emacs Org mode also have this behavior though...)

#+begin_src ruby :results output
included_file = <<HERE  
Hello
#+INCLUDE: "./spec/html_examples/only-list.org"
World
HERE

puts included_file
#+end_src

* DONE Within a list

- A list that has an included file directive
  + Only go to the first level
    * when included it always goes to the first level and absorbs next list items
#+INCLUDE: "./spec/html_examples/only-list.org"
    * 3rd level
  + 3rd level, though it should be a different list

* DONE Within a table, cannot be included
