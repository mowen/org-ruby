Advanced Lists

`org-ruby` supports the following list features of `org-mode`:

# Nested lists

 * You can have nested lists
 * This is first-level
  * This is a nested item
  * This is another nested item
 * Back to the first level
 * Another first level item
  * This is a numbered list nested within the unordered list
  * This is another numbered item

Note the list ends just some more text. Make sure both list blocks
are closed.

# Multi-paragraph list items

This list will end with the end-of-file. Make sure all blocks are closed.

 * This is a list item
 * This list item has multiple paragraphs.

This is paragraph two.

And paragraph three.
 * Back to a list item.
  * Nested, just for grins!
  * woo hoo!
